# TextPrediction
Contains program in Python where RNN has been implemented to predict text.
1. Used work by Shakespeare to train the model.
2. Used TensorFlow and scikit-learn library to covert text into one-hot-encoding format.
3. Using TensorFlow implemented multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network to predict the next character by feeding any random character.
